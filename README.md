# rock-paper-scissors
A rock-paper-scissors game coded in JavaScript. Now with a GUI.

1) First to reach a score of 5 wins the game.
2) Round is initiated when the user makes their choice by choosing rock, paper or scissors.
3) Even if you leave after playing a single round and lets be honest rps against a computer aint very fun, hope the changing background color brings you at least some joy lmao so, have fun!

P.S The Confetti, animated gradient backgrounds and other animations will be added if I ever return to this project. Might add Guns too to make it interesting.
